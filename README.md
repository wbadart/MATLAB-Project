# MATLAB-Project

#####The intention of this project is to develop a program that will decode a password submitted by a user. The program will reference a library of common passwords for increased efficiency (efficiency beyond that of a pure brute force method alone).  The program will also provide feedback on increasing the password’s strength. These user interactions will require the use of a graphical user interface.  Once the password is cracked, the program will interface with a device, ultimately unlocking a physical lock connected to a rig.  Possible limitations include, but are not limited to: length of the password being tested, time to crack, and complexity.  Underlying mathematical principles would be the development of an algorithm to maximize the efficiency of the program (Big O Notation).
